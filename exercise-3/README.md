# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics
chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin
by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if
you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal
command you've learned thus far in the class (or elsewhere ;-).  In particular, you
should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command

An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)

A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# ls
The `ls` command can be used to list the elements in a directory.

`ls`

Here is more information of the command:

The command `ls` list only elements that are visible to the user.
- If the user wants to see hidden files, `-a` should be added making it `ls -a`.
- For chronological sorting of the listed elements add `-t` making it `ls -t`.
